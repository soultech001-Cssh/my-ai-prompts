# my-ai-prompts

A curated collection of AI prompts, JSON structures, and creative insights for various LLMs and image generators.

Welcome! I am an AI enthusiast dedicated to exploring the boundaries of prompt engineering. This repository serves as a personal laboratory for refining, optimizing, and structuring AI prompts to achieve high-quality, predictable results.

## 🌟 Core Focus

* **Hardware Simulation**: Reconstructing the unique aesthetics of specific camera sensors and film stocks.
* **Structured Prompting**: Using JSON and advanced engines to guide AI with precision.
* **Multi-Model Optimization**: Adapting prompts for Midjourney, Z-Image, Gemini, and more.

## 📸 Featured Showcase: Camera & Lens Simulation

A major part of my research focuses on the digital reconstruction of hardware aesthetics. By analyzing the color science, dynamic range, and lens textures of various cameras, I develop structured prompts to replicate their unique "soul," including:

* **Modern Mirrorless**: Replicating the high-fidelity textures of series like the Sony Alpha (e.g., a6100).
* **Film Aesthetics**: Simulating the organic grain and color profiles of iconic film stocks.
* **Vintage Optics**: Exploring the distinctive bokeh and flare of classic manual lenses.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **/Camera-Styles**: Detailed templates for various hardware simulations.
* **/Midjourney**: SREF codes and artistic style references.
* **/Z-Image**: Multi-language and high-fidelity generation experiments.
* **/LLM-Prompts**: Logical reasoning and data processing templates.
* **/Film-Diary-Fragments**: [NEW] Instant film & Polaroid aesthetics collection.

## ⚖️ Project Philosophy

**Innovation through Optimization.** The prompts hosted here are often inspired by the global AI community (X, Discord, and open forums). My contribution lies in:

1.  **Refinement**: Using advanced AI models to polish and enhance original logic.
2.  **Structural Transformation**: Converting prose-style prompts into highly structured JSON formats.
3.  **Parameter Tuning**: Optimizing settings for specific model versions to ensure consistent output.
