# my-ai-prompts

> A curated collection of AI prompts, JSON structures, and creative insights for various LLMs and image generators.

Welcome! I am an AI enthusiast dedicated to exploring the boundaries of prompt engineering. This repository serves as a personal laboratory for refining, optimizing, and structuring AI prompts to achieve high-quality, predictable results.

## 🌟 Core Focus
- **Camera Simulations**: Recreating specific photographic textures (e.g., Sony a6100 style).
- **Structured Prompting**: Using JSON and advanced engines to guide AI with precision.
- **Multi-Model Optimization**: Adapting prompts for Midjourney, Z-Image, Gemini, and more.

## 📸 Featured Showcase: Sony a6100 Simulation
One of my primary projects involves simulating the unique photographic aesthetic of the Sony a6100 camera. This includes detailed JSON structures designed to replicate its scene selections and sensor characteristics.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/Midjourney`: SREF codes and artistic style references.
- `/Z-Image`: Multi-language and high-fidelity generation experiments.
- `/LLM-Prompts`: Logical reasoning and data processing templates.

## ⚖️ Project Philosophy
**Innovation through Optimization.** The prompts hosted here are often inspired by the global AI community (X, Discord, and open forums). My contribution lies in:
1. **Refinement**: Using advanced AI models to polish and enhance original logic.
2. **Structural Transformation**: Converting prose-style prompts into highly structured JSON formats.
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Optimizing settings for specific model versions to ensure consistent output.

*Note: This repository is intended for personal study and creative exploration.*
